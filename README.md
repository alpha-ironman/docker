docker run -it --name _containername_ --mount _source=volumename,destination=/foldername_ _imagename_- to create a container with volume (This will mount volume into the sepcified foldername inside the container, bydefault /data is used)  
docker run -it --name _containername_ -v _volumeanme_:/_foldername_ _imagename_ -  Same as above command  
docker run -it --volumes-from container1 --name container2 imagename /bin/bash - will create the a new container (container2) with volume already use in another container(container1)  
docker run -it --name _containername_ -v "$(pwd)":/foldername imagename - will mount the host directory as a data volume
